A webinar on demand is viewable either \"live\", at the time of creation, or \"on demand\", at the convenience of users.

The Zoom host for each DCMI Virtual session will normally be either Paul or Tom.

Check the option for webinar on demand to enable automatic recording of the session. (Note that unchecking the option for automatic recording would also uncheck the \"on-demand\" option, in which case recordings would be available for download by the host, but not by conference delegates.) Note that configuring a webinar as \"on-demand\", aside from triggering automatic recording, also triggers a requirement that each participant, including Zoom hosts, moderators, and members of the audience, \"register\" with Zoom by typing their name and email address. The registration can be customized but should require no more than the minimum of name and email address. Add panelists by adding their email addresses under @@@. This will trigger [an email from Zoom - does it? @@] Practice sessions The Zoom host must arrange for a practice session with (at a minimum) the moderator. The Zoom host must make the moderator co-host. The moderator should know: How to monitor Q&A (regular and anonymous). How to unmute an attendee so that they can ask a question orally. During the session Note that all sound in the session, from start to finish, will be captured in the recording. Start the webinar exactly five minutes prior to the scheduled time and immediately announce: \"This session will start in five minutes\". Verify that \"share sound\" is checked in the @@@ menu so that sound will be captured from all presentations. Promote the session moderator to \"co-host\" by clicking on @@@ At the top of the hour, prompt the session moderator (if required) to welcome attendees and introduce the speakers. During the webinar, monitor the \"chat\" channel. This will be used only for internal communicating about technical issues such as sound quality. The chat channel will not be made not be made available for download with the session recording. Questions asked in the Q&A channel are the responsibility not of the Zoom host, but of the session moderator. If the questions posed in the Q&A channel are all answered and the moderator wants to take a question live, from webinar attendees who raise their hand, those attendees can be unmuted (prompted to \"panelist\") either by the Zoom host or by the moderator.
