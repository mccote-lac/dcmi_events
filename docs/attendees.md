## Attendees

1. Attendees who register for DCMI Virtual, either before or during the conference, will have the option of viewing recordings of all sessions for the duration of the conference.

2. Attendees do not need to have (or be logged into) a Zoom account in order to participate. However, a Zoom app must be installed on the attendee's computer in order to join a session. Clicking the link provided by email after registration will launch the Zoom app on the attendee's computer (or invite the user to download the app, then launch).

3. When the Zoom app is launched, the user will be invited to fill out a registration form (name and email address) to gain access. Note that once the browser has launched the Zoom app, the browser is no longer needed for access to the Zoom session.

4. Once the zoom.us page in the browser has launched the Zoom app, the browser is no longer needed and any zoom.us pages can safely be closed.
