## Panelists

There are two types of panelists: moderators (usually just one) and presenters. For all panelists:

1. Use of wired Internet and headsets with microphones is strongly recommended. 

2. All panlists will receive an email (from Zoom? @@@) with a URL for joining their session.

3. When clicking on the session URL, all panelists will need to "register" for their own session by typing their name and email address when prompted.

4. All panelists must join the call five minutes before the start of their session. 

5. All panelists can mute/unmute their own audio or video and share their own screen.

### Moderators

The moderator of a DCMI Virtual session welcomes attendees to the session, introduces its speakers, and handles Q&A. Please note:

2. A moderator is designated by the Zoom host as "co-host", which allows them to unmute and mute the audio of other webinar participants during Q&A (see below) and to perform other administrative tasks if necessary. 

3. To allow an attendee to speak (for example, to ask a question), right-click on their name in the "attendees" tab (@@@) and select "allow to speak". The attendee will then appear in the gallery view as a "panelist", and their name will be displayed. Consider re-muting attendees after they have finished asking their questions.

4. During the presentations, the moderator is responsible for watching the [Q&A channel](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203686015-Getting-started-with-Question-Answer) and for selecting and prioritizing questions to be put to the panelists. The Q&A channel has been configured to allow anonymous questions. Attendees will see only those questions that have been marked by the moderator as "answered". (Alternatively, the Q&A channel can be configured to show all questions to all attendees, as they are posed, and allow them to upvote and comment on the questions.)
