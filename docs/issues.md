## Issues

#### On-demand recordings

- Must Zoom hosts go to the Recordings page and manually click on anything to make the recording available "on demand"?
- Will we want or need to delete extra recording files to exclude them from download by viewing "on demand" (for example, the "gallery view" or the contents of text channels)? If so, should this be done right after the call?

#### Access

- What is the role of the passcode?

#### Hosts and panelists

- In which menu does the host add panelists?
- After the host adds a panelist to the session, what sort of email is sent to the panelist? It is sent by Zoom?
- Where is the "share sound" option that must be activated to ensure that all presentations are captured in the recording? Can this be pre-configured?
- In which menu can the Zoom host promote a session moderator to "co-host"?
- Attendees can be allowed to speak by right-clicking on their name in which tab (@@@)?

#### Email from EventBrite and Zoom

- After calls, who receives follow-up mail for what purpose?
- Will Zoom hosts receive email with information about attendees of the live webinar and about registered participants who opted to watch the recording "on-demand", or do these need to be requested manually?
- Will all panelists receive an email (from Zoom? @@@) with a URL for joining their session?
- How is the URL for a session communicated to registered attendees? By email? With a different URL for each session?
